# Pomodoro timer
Practice project for OFP Web Developer training - a pomodoro timer with adjustable fonts and timings.

# Get started
## Basic usage
Select what type of timer you want to start, then click the play button to start the timer. It will ring softly to let you know time's run out.

## Settings

The app will remember your settings even after you close your browser or refresh the page !

### Fonts
You have 3 choices for font faces and colours, to suit your mood the best. My personal favorite is the 3rd font in red !

### Durations
You can pick different durations for focus and break periods. Simply move the sliders around and you're set !

### Automatic Pomodoro Cycling
By clicking the box at the bottom of settings, the timer will cycle automatically ! From a focus period, to a short break, back to a focus, and so on.
The cycles slider lets you define how many "focus / short break" cycles you want before enjoying a long break.

# Made with
This project uses webpack and babel for the distribuable. CSS generated by webpack from SCSS.
